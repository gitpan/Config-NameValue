    Config::NameValue - Round trip simple name/value config file handling.

VERSION
      This document describes v1.03 of Config::NameValue - released February 09, 2012 as part of Config-NameValue.

SYNOPSIS
      use Config::NameValue;
      my $c = Config::NameValue->new( 'config.file' );

DESCRIPTION
    Load simple name=value pair configuration files and save them.

    Blank lines and comments are ignored.

      # Begin config file

      # Everything up to here will be ignored but continued in saved file.

      name1=value1
      name2=value2 # everything after the octothorpe will be ignored but be saved in the file when changes are made

METHODS
  new
    Returns a Config::NameValue object. Can optionally be passed a filename,
    which will be loaded via the "load" command.

  load
    Loads and parses the specified configuration file.

    Leading and trailing whitespace are stripped.

      name1=value1
        name1=value1   # are equivalent

  save
    Saves the configuration, with any changes, to a file.

    If no filename is passed the original file is overwritten, otherwise a
    new file will be created.

    As a special case, if the original filename is explicitly passed to save
    and there have been no changes an exception will be thrown.

  get
    Returns the value for the requested name, undef for nonexistant or empty
    names.

  set
    Modifies the requested name with the supplied value.

    If the name does not exist it will be created and saved with a comment
    indicating that it was added by this program
